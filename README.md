# Fantasy Football Data Analysis
A blog post was created to explain the details of this project.


## Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze data related to Serie A Fantasy Football (aka **Fantacalcio**) from past years and use the results to predict the best players for the next football season.  
The code is contained in a Jupyter Notebook file, which can be used to import data, visualize the graphs and get results of the analysis.


## Visualizations
The following are some of the results obtained by analyzing the data.
